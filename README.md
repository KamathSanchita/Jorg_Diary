# Jorg_Diary
This repository is meant to track all the necessary steps to successfully make and improve the tool Jorg run. The git page for the study is [Here](https://github.com/lmlui/Jorg/tree/master).

Jorg is a tool developed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley team. The tool is made to circularize a genome(a MAG specifically for better results). 
We have tried it hands-on and benchmarked the tool based on its dependent parameters.

Benchmarking :
Contig number : 
Bins from the Jorg study were filtered so that bins with contigs ranging from 1 to 20 were chosen to work with.

Coverage of a bin: Out of the filtered lot based on contig number, bins with coverage more significant than 25 and less than 250 are chosen.

Additional scripts: All the scripts used for this project are saved in the folder called ```scripts```.
