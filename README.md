# Jorg_Diary
This repository is meant to track all the necessary steps to successfully make the tool Jorg run and improve it.

Jorg is a tool developed by the Berklin University team to circularize a genome(a MAG specifically for better results)(add a reference here). 
Here, we have tried hands on it and benchmarked the tool based o its dependent parameteres.

Benchmarking :
Contig number : 
Bins from the Jorg study were filtered such that the bins with contigs ranging from 1 to 20 were chosen to work with.

Coverage of a bin: Out of the filtered lot based on contig number, bins with coverage greater than 25 and less than 250 are chosen.

Additional scripts: All the scripts used for this project are saved in the folder called ```scripts```.
